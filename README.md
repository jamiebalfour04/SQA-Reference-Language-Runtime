# SQA Haggis Runtime powered by ZPE
This program is designed to read SQA Reference Language code (Haggis), parse it, compile it and run it through the ZPE Runtime Environment 
(ZRE) within the ZPE Programming Environment (https://www.jamiebalfour.scot/projects/zpe/). It's fast due to the performance of ZPE and can also be compiled 
to run natively on a system with GraalVM very easily. 

It features a built-in UI editor, similar to but not as functional as the ZPE UI Editor, a command line interface and the ability to compile SQARL files directly into a binary and run them later.

To download, agree to the terms and conditions for downloading from my website at https://jamiebalfour.scot/terms/?terms=software&type=1-zpe&file=sqarl-zpe-parser and enjoy!
