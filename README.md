# SQA Reference Language Runtime powered by ZPE
This is a pre-processor for the YASS programming language. The program is designed to read SQA Reference Language, parse it, transpile it to YASS and run it (or compile it) through the ZPE Runtime Environment
(ZRE) within the ZPE Programming Environment (https://www.jamiebalfour.scot/projects/zpe/). It's fast due to the performance of ZPE and can also be compiled to run natively on a system with GraalVM native image. 

It features a built-in UI editor similar to but not as functional as the ZPE UI Editor, a command-line interface, and the ability to compile SQARL files directly into a binary and run them later.
